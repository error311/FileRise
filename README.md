## Features

- **Multiple File/Folder Uploads with Progress (Resumable.js Integration):**
  - Users can effortlessly upload multiple files and folders simultaneously by either selecting them through the file picker or dragging and dropping them directly into the interface.
  - **Chunked Uploads:** Files are uploaded in configurable chunks (default set as 3 MB) to efficiently handle large files.
  - **Pause, Resume, and Retry:** Uploads can be paused and resumed at any time, with support for retrying failed chunks.
  - **Real-Time Progress:** Each file shows an individual progress bar that displays percentage complete and upload speed.
  - **File & Folder Grouping:** When many files are dropped, files are automatically grouped into a scrollable wrapper, ensuring the interface remains clean.
  - **Secure Uploads:** All uploads integrate CSRF token validation and other security checks.

- **Built-in File Editing & Renaming:**
  - Text-based files (e.g., .txt, .html, .js) can be opened and edited in a modal window using CodeMirror for:
    - Syntax highlighting
    - Line numbering
    - Adjustable font sizes
  - Files can be renamed directly through the interface.
  - The renaming functionality now supports names with parentheses and checks for duplicate names, automatically generating a unique name (e.g., appending “ (1)”) when needed.
  - Folder-specific metadata is updated accordingly.
  - **Enhanced File Editing Check:** Files with a Content-Length of 0 KB are now allowed to be edited.

- **Built-in File Preview:**
  - Users can quickly preview images, videos, audio and PDFs directly in modal popups without leaving the page.
  - The preview modal supports inline display of images (with proper scaling) and videos with playback controls.
  - Navigation (prev/next) within image previews is supported for a seamless browsing experience.

- **Gallery (Grid) View:**
  - In addition to the traditional table view, users can toggle to a gallery view that arranges image thumbnails in a grid layout.
  - The gallery view offers multiple column options (e.g., 3, 4, or 5 columns) so that users can choose the layout that best fits their screen.
  - Action buttons (Download, Edit, Rename, Share) appear beneath each thumbnail for quick access.

- **Batch Operations (Delete/Copy/Move/Download/Extract Zip):**
  - **Delete Files:** Delete multiple files at once.
  - **Copy Files:** Copy selected files to another folder with a unique-naming feature to prevent overwrites.
  - **Move Files:** Move selected files to a different folder, automatically generating a unique filename if needed to avoid data loss.
  - **Download Files as ZIP:** Download selected files as a ZIP archive. Users can specify a custom name for the ZIP file via a modal dialog.
  - **Extract Zip:** When one or more ZIP files are selected, users can extract the archive(s) directly into the current folder.
  - **Drag & Drop (File Movement):** Easily move files by selecting them from the file list and dragging them onto your desired folder in the folder tree or breadcrumb. When you drop the files onto a folder, the system automatically moves them, updating your file organization in one seamless action.
  - **Enhanced Context Menu & Keyboard Shortcuts:**
    - **Right-Click Context Menu:**
      - A custom context menu appears on right-clicking within the file list.
      - For multiple selections, options include Delete Selected, Copy Selected, Move Selected, Download Zip, and (if applicable) Extract Zip.
      - When exactly one file is selected, additional options (Preview, Edit [if editable], Rename, and Tag File) are available.
    - **Keyboard Shortcut for Deletion:**
      - A global keydown listener detects Delete/Backspace key presses (when no input is focused) to trigger the delete operation.

- **File Tagging and Global Tag Management:**
  - **Context Menu Tagging:**
    - Single-file tagging: “Tag File” option in the right-click menu opens a modal to add a tag (with name and color) to the file.
    - Multi-file tagging: When multiple files are selected, a “Tag Selected” option opens a multi‑file tagging modal to apply the same tag to all selected files.
  - **Tagging Modals & Custom Dropdown:**
    - Dedicated modals provide an interface for adding and updating tags.
    - A custom dropdown in each modal displays available global tags with a colored preview and a remove icon.
  - **Global Tag Store:**
    - Tags are stored globally (persisted in a JSON file) for reuse across files and sessions.
    - New tags added to any file are automatically added to the global store.
    - Users can remove a global tag directly from the dropdown, which removes it from the available tag list for all files.
  - **Unified Search Filtering:**
    - The single search box now filters files based on both file names and tag names (case‑insensitive).

- **Folder Management:**
  - Organize files into folders and subfolders with the ability to create, rename, and delete folders.
  - A dynamic folder tree in the UI allows users to navigate directories easily, with real-time updates.
  - **Per-Folder Metadata Storage:** Each folder has its own metadata JSON file (e.g., `root_metadata.json`, `FolderName_metadata.json`), updated with operations like copy/move/rename.
  - **Intuitive Breadcrumb Navigation:** Clickable breadcrumbs enable users to quickly jump to any parent folder; supports drag & drop for moving files.
  - **Folder Manager Context Menu:**
    - Right-clicking on a folder brings up a custom context menu with options for creating, renaming, and deleting folders.
  - **Keyboard Shortcut for Folder Deletion:**
    - A global key listener (Delete/Backspace) triggers folder deletion with safeguards to prevent deletion of the root folder.

- **Sorting & Pagination:**
  - Files can be sorted by name, modified date, upload date, file size, or uploader.
  - Pagination controls let users navigate through files with selectable page sizes (10, 20, 50, or 100 items per page) and “Prev”/“Next” buttons.

- **Share Link Functionality:**
  - Generate shareable links for files with configurable expiration times (e.g., 30, 60, 120, 180, 240 minutes, and 1 day) and optional password protection.
  - Share links are stored in a JSON file with details including folder, file, expiration timestamp, and hashed password.
  - The share endpoint validates tokens, expiration, and password before serving files (or forcing downloads).
  - The share URL is configurable via environment variables or auto-detected from the server.

- **User Authentication & Management:**
  - Secure, session-based authentication protects the file manager.
  - Admin users can add or remove users through the interface.
  - Passwords are hashed using PHP’s `password_hash()` for security.
  - All state-changing endpoints include CSRF token validation.
  - Password change functionality is supported for all users.
  - Basic Auth is available for login.
  - **Persistent Login (Remember Me) with Encrypted Tokens:**
    - Users can remain logged in across sessions securely.
    - Persistent tokens are encrypted using AES‑256‑CBC before being stored in a JSON file.
    - On auto-login, tokens are decrypted on the server to re-establish user sessions without re-authentication.

- **Responsive, Dynamic & Persistent UI:**
  - The interface is mobile-friendly and adapts to various screen sizes by hiding non-critical columns on small devices.
  - Asynchronous updates (via Fetch API and XMLHttpRequest) keep the UI responsive without full page reloads.
  - Persistent settings (such as items per page, dark/light mode preference, folder tree state, and the last open folder) ensure a smooth, customized user experience.

- **Dark Mode/Light Mode:**
  - The application automatically adapts to the operating system’s theme preference by default, with a manual toggle available.
  - Dark mode provides a darker background with lighter text, and UI elements (including the CodeMirror editor) are adjusted for optimal readability in low-light conditions.
  - Light mode maintains a bright interface suitable for well-lit environments.

- **Server & Security Enhancements:**
  - Apache (or .htaccess) configurations disable directory indexing (e.g., using `Options -Indexes` in the uploads directory), preventing unauthorized file browsing.
  - Direct access to sensitive files (e.g., `users.txt`) is restricted via .htaccess rules.
  - A proxy download mechanism (via endpoints like `download.php` and `downloadZip.php`) routes all file downloads through PHP, ensuring session and CSRF token validation before file access.
  - Administrators are advised to deploy the app on a secure internal network or use the proxy download mechanism for public deployments.

- **Trash Management with Restore & Delete:**
  - **Trash Storage & Metadata:**
    - Deleted files are moved to a designated “Trash” folder rather than being immediately removed.
    - Metadata is stored in a JSON file (`trash.json`) that records:
      - Original folder and file name
      - Timestamp when the file was trashed
      - Uploader information (and optionally who deleted it)
      - Additional metadata (e.g., file type)
  - **Restore Functionality:**
    - Admins can view trashed files in a modal and restore individual or all files back to their original location (with conflict checks).
  - **Delete Functionality:**
    - Users can permanently delete trashed files via:
      - **Delete Selected:** Remove specific files from the Trash and update `trash.json`.
      - **Delete All:** Permanently remove every file from the Trash after confirmation.
  - **Auto-Purge Mechanism:**
    - The system automatically purges files in the Trash older than three days, managing storage and preventing accumulation of outdated files.
  - **Trash UI:**
    - The trash modal displays file name, uploader/deleter, and trashed date/time.
    - Material icons with tooltips represent restore and delete actions.

- **Drag & Drop Cards with Dedicated Drop Zones:**
  - **Sidebar Drop Zone:**  
    - Cards (e.g., upload or folder management) can be dragged into a dedicated sidebar drop zone for quick access to frequently used operations.
    - The sidebar drop zone expands dynamically to accept drops anywhere within its visual area.
  - **Top Bar Drop Zone:**  
    - A top drop zone is available for reordering or managing cards quickly.
    - Dragging a card to the top drop zone provides immediate visual feedback, ensuring a fluid and customizable workflow.
  - **Seamless Interaction:**  
    - Both drop zones support smooth drag-and-drop interactions with animations and pointer event adjustments, ensuring reliable card placement regardless of screen position.

## 🔒 Admin Panel, TOTP & OpenID Connect (OIDC) Integration

- **Flexible Authentication:**
  - Supports multiple authentication methods including Form-based Login, Basic Auth, OpenID Connect (OIDC), and TOTP-based Two-Factor Authentication.
  - Ensures continuous secure access by allowing administrators to disable only two of the available login options at any time.

- **Secure OIDC Authentication:**
  - Seamlessly integrates with OIDC providers (e.g., Keycloak, Okta).
  - Provides admin-configurable OIDC settings—including Provider URL, Client ID, Client Secret, and Redirect URI.
  - Stores all sensitive configurations in an encrypted JSON file.

- **TOTP Two-Factor Authentication:**
  - Enhances security by integrating Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) functionality.
  - The new User Panel automatically displays the TOTP setup modal when users enable TOTP, presenting a QR code for easy configuration in authenticator apps.
  - Administrators can customize a global OTPAuth URL template for consistent TOTP provisioning across accounts.

- **Dynamic Admin Panel:**
  - Features an intuitive interface with Material Icons for quick recognition and access.
  - Allows administrators to manage authentication settings, user management, and login methods in real time.
  - Includes real-time validation that prevents the accidental disabling of all authentication methods simultaneously.

## Installation & Setup

### Manual Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Repository:**
   - **Clone:**  

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/error311/FileRise.git
     ```

   - **Download:**  
     Download the latest release from the GitHub releases page and extract it into your desired directory.

2. **Deploy to Your Web Server:**
   - Place the project files in your Apache web directory (e.g., `/var/www/html`).
   - Ensure PHP 8.1+ is installed along with the required extensions (`php-json`, `php-curl`, `php-zip`, etc.).

3. **Install Composer Dependencies (Required for OIDC Support):**
   - Install Composer if you haven't already ([Installation Guide](https://getcomposer.org/download/)).
   - Navigate to the project directory and run:

     ```bash
     composer install
     ```

   - This step will install necessary dependencies like `jumbojett/openid-connect-php` and `phpseclib/phpseclib`.

4. **Directory Setup & Permissions:**
   - Create the following directories if they do not exist, and set appropriate permissions:
     - `uploads/` – for file storage.
     - `users/` – to store `users.txt` (user authentication data).
     - `metadata/` – for storing `file_metadata.json` and other metadata.
   - Example commands:

     ```bash
     mkdir -p /var/www/uploads /var/www/users /var/www/metadata
     chmod -R 775 /var/www/uploads /var/www/users /var/www/metadata
     ```

5. **Configure Apache:**
   - Ensure that directory indexing is disabled (using `Options -Indexes` in your `.htaccess` or Apache configuration).
   - Make sure the Apache configuration allows URL rewriting if needed.

6. **Configuration File:**
   - Open `config.php` and adjust the following constants as necessary:
     - `BASE_URL`: Set this to your web app’s base URL.
     - `UPLOAD_DIR`: Adjust the directory path for uploads.
     - `TIMEZONE`: Set to your preferred timezone.
     - `TOTAL_UPLOAD_SIZE`: Ensure it matches PHP’s `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` settings in your `php.ini`.

### Initial Setup Instructions

- **First Launch Admin Setup:**  
  On first launch, if no users exist, the application will enter a setup mode. You will be prompted to create an admin user. This is handled automatically by the application (e.g., via a “Create Admin” form).  
  **Note:** No default credentials are provided. You must create the first admin account to log in and manage additional users.

---

## Docker Usage

For users who prefer containerization, a Docker image is available.

**Note:** The Docker image already includes Composer dependencies pre-installed (including OIDC support).

### Quickstart

1. **Pull the Docker Image:**

   ```bash
   docker pull error311/filerise-docker:latest
   ```

   macos M series:

   ```bash
   docker pull --platform linux/x86_64 error311/filerise-docker:latest
   ```

2. **Run the Container:**

   ```bash
   docker run -d \
   -p 80:80 \
   -e TIMEZONE="America/New_York" \
   -e TOTAL_UPLOAD_SIZE="5G" \
   -e SECURE="false" \
   -v /path/to/your/uploads:/var/www/uploads \
   -v /path/to/your/users:/var/www/users \
   -v /path/to/your/metadata:/var/www/metadata \
   --name FileRise \
   error311/filerise-docker:latest
   ```

3. **Using Docker Compose:**

   Create a docker-compose.yml file with the following content:

   ```yaml
   version: "3.8"
   services:
     web:
       image: error311/filerise-docker:latest
       ports:
         - "80:80"
       environment:
         TIMEZONE: "America/New_York"
         TOTAL_UPLOAD_SIZE: "5G"
         SECURE: "false"
         PERSISTENT_TOKENS_KEY: "default_please_change_this_key"
       volumes:
         - /path/to/your/uploads:/var/www/uploads
         - /path/to/your/users:/var/www/users
         - /path/to/your/metadata:/var/www/metadata
   ```

**Then start the container with:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

---

## Configuration Guidance

The `config.php` file contains several key constants that may need adjustment for your deployment:

- **BASE_URL:**  
  Set to the URL where your application is hosted (e.g., `http://yourdomain.com/uploads/`).

- **UPLOAD_DIR, USERS_DIR, META_DIR:**  
  Define the directories for uploads, user data, and metadata. Adjust these to match your server environment or Docker volume mounts.

- **TIMEZONE & DATE_TIME_FORMAT:**  
  Set according to your regional settings.

- **TOTAL_UPLOAD_SIZE:**  
  Defines the maximum upload size (default is `5G`). Ensure that PHP’s `upload_max_filesize` and `post_max_size` in your `php.ini` are consistent with this setting. The startup script (`start.sh`) updates PHP limits at runtime based on this value.

- **Environment Variables (Docker):**  
  The Docker image supports overriding configuration via environment variables. For example, you can set `SECURE`, `SHARE_URL`, `PERSISTENT_TOKENS_KEY` and port settings via the container’s environment.

---

## Additional Information

- **Security:**  
  All state-changing endpoints use CSRF token validation. Ensure that sessions and tokens are correctly configured as per your deployment environment.

- **Permissions:**  
  Both manual and Docker installations include steps to ensure that file and directory permissions are set correctly for the web server to read and write as needed.

- **Logging & Troubleshooting:**  
  Check Apache logs (located in `/var/log/apache2/`) for troubleshooting any issues during deployment or operation.
