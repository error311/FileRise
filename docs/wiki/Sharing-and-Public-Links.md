# Sharing and public links

FileRise lets you share files or folders using public links.

## Sharing basics

- Create a share link from the file or folder actions menu.
- Share links can be set to expire and can require a password.
- Anyone with the link can access it, so treat links as public.
- To revoke access, delete the share link or remove the share entry.

## ACLs and sharing

- The "Can share" user permission controls who can create share links.
- Encrypted-at-rest folders disable sharing by design.
- Use ACLs to limit which folders a user can see or share.

## Tips

- Use ACLs to limit what users can share.
- Avoid sharing admin-only or sensitive folders.
- Rotate share links if they were posted publicly.
