# Admin gotchas

Common points of confusion for admins.

## Pro not showing up

- Confirm your license is saved in Admin -> FileRise Pro.
- Confirm the Pro bundle is installed and readable.
- Ensure your core version matches the Pro bundle version.

## Updates expired

- Pro keeps working on your current bundle.
- Renew only if you want newer Pro bundles.

## Upload problems

- Check PHP upload size and post limits.
- Verify the web server user can write to `uploads/` and `users/`.

## Instance IDs

- 12-month updates plans require Instance IDs at checkout.
- Business licenses can add Instance IDs at /pro/instances.php.
- Personal licenses require support to change Instance IDs.
