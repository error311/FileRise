# Search Everywhere (Pro)

Search Everywhere finds files across the folders and Sources you are allowed to access.

## How it works

- Results are ACL-aware and respect per-folder permissions.
- When multiple Sources are enabled, results appear per source as they return.
- Slow remote sources do not block faster local results.

## Tips

- Use specific keywords for large trees.
- Expect remote sources to take longer than local storage.
- If a source is unavailable, it will show a status message instead of blocking the search.
